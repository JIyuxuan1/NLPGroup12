(Photo: IBT)Andrew Korybko The DuranMay 2016: As Filipinos choose their next President on Monday, prospect of election of anti-establishment candidate threatens the geopolitical viability of the US s Pivot to Asia.The Philippines votes for its next President on Monday.  Whilst the rest of the world pays little attention, strategists in Washington are worried.The electoral frontrunner is Rodrigo Duterte, an eccentric, no-nonsense former mayor from the southern island of Mindanao who commands a Trump-like popularity and an equally loyal following. He has shaken Philippine politics to its core over the past couple of months, defying establishment pundits who   just as they did with Trump   wrongly predicted that his campaign would fizzle out over the course of each passing week.Having totally underestimated just how dissatisfied most Filipinos are with the status quo, Duterte s rivals missed the chance to outshine him by his anti-system rhetoric. With the race in its final days that is now too late.  Instead   also paralleling what happened with Trump   there are desperate calls for coalitions and deals to stop him.Should these fail and should Duterte win on Monday, he promises a geopolitical revolution unlike anything the Philippines has ever seen in its history. Pivoting To Asia Through The PhilippinesThe US s Pivot to Asia was announced by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the fall of 2011 with the unstated but obvious goal of  containing  China. Key to this strategy is the  rebalancing    as the Pentagon calls it   of an estimated 60% of its overseas forces to the Asia-Pacific theatre. Such a major deployment requires many more bases than the US currently has in the region. The US has therefore sought the help of the loyal leader of its former Philippines colony, Benigno Aquino III, to find a way to re-open its bases in the Philippines which under popular pressure were closed in the 1990s.Using the  China threat  as the  plausibly justifiable  reason for doing so, but aware that the Philippines people still resent their former coloniser and are proud of having forced the US to close its Philippines bases at the end of the Cold War, the US has devised what it calls an  Enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement  (EDCA) that allows for the  rotational presence  of American troops in at least five separate bases, one of which is located on the strategic island of Palawan that abuts the South China Sea.Although not legally  permanent  or  officially  controlled by the US, this wink-and-a-nod arrangement would in reality allow the US to redeploy its forces to the Philippines, returning the Philippines archipelago to the role of the US s second  unsinkable aircraft carrier  (alongside Japan) which it had during the Cold War.The  China Containment Coalition The Pentagon plans to use the Philippines as the maritime lynch of its  China Containment Coalition  (CCC), gathering all of its allies  navies together and deploying them within provocative striking range of China s claimed islands.The other three members of the US-led Quadrilateral Security Dialogue   Japan, India, and Australia   would find their own way to  rotate  their military units throughout the Philippines islands as well, thereby forming the core of the CCC.To add a regional element to this mix, the plan is for the Philippines and Vietnam, both of which contest some of China s maritime claims, to intensify their strategic cooperation to the point of a mutual defence treaty. This would draw Vietnam into the network of the anti-China coalition being built up by Washington by using the defence ties between Vietnam and the Philippines to making the members of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue de facto allies of Vietnam.Altogether, the Pentagon plan is to produce a critical mass of hostile states near China s southern maritime border which backed by the US could quickly  counter  any moves by Beijing thereby  containing  it to the East Asian mainland.Duterte s RevolutionEverything was proceeding according to plan until Duterte began to question the  Enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement . While his running mate has said Duterte would honour the agreement, he added that he would do so  from a position of strength .Back in October 2014, Duterte went on record to say the  Enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement  should be scrapped if it allowed US servicemen in the Philippines to avoid justice for any crimes they committed.This pinpoints an issue very sensitive for Filipinos who have vivid memories of how US troops were able to escape punishment for acts of gross misbehaviour whilst the US military occupied its bases in the Philippines.  Public anger over this issue was one of the key factors in mobilising local opposition to the bases and explains why many Filipinos oppose their return.Since it is impossible to imagine such an incident not arising at some point, it is all but inevitable that a situation will occur which will fulfil Duterte s criterion for scrapping the  Enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement  Taken together with Duterte s assertion that he intends to deal with the US  from a position of strength  it is easy to see how this might trigger the process of revoking the agreement.No Filipino politician has previously spoken about the US in this way.  Moreover other things he has said also suggest an intention to send a strongly independent line.Not surprisingly the Pentagon-affiliated publication  Starts and Stripes , which writes for US servicemen servicemen and their families, published a scathing critique of Duterte just last week.  Here are some excerpts: With Filipinos set to choose among five candidates on May 9, Duterte, the incumbent mayor of Davao City who has said the U.S.  should not meddle in our affairs,  holds a strong lead, according to the most recent poll released Sunday.Duterte is very popular now because people are sick and tired of the same old, same old,  said Virginia Bacay Watson, a professor at the Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies in Honolulu.  He s kind of a fresh face, fresh perspective, compared to the other elites who are running. Duterte has presented himself to voters as a straight-talker who is not part of the Manila elite   someone who can get things done even if he needs to bend the rules to do so. That includes the country s foreign affairs. He feels that American influence is too strong, that we re too dependent on U.S. intervention in anything we do,  said Babe Romualdez, an opinion columnist for The Philippine Star newspaper who has interviewed the candidates one-on-one about their platforms on the U.S. military and relations with China. He was an activist when he was a student and young lawyer,  Romualdez said.  I get a sense that he s saying the same things that most of the militants say. In Romualdez s interview with the front-runner, the candidate said  we really don t need the Americans to deal with the Chinese because the Chinese want to talk to us alone. If I become president I m going to reach out to the Chinese and talk to them alone without American intervention,  he said.Duterte publically opposed the Visiting Forces Agreement with the U.S.   of which the EDCA was an amendment   and claimed in 2013 that he had rejected a request by the U.S. to establish Davao as a base of operations for drones.Earlier this year, he was quoted saying that although the country was now bound by the EDCA, he had  reservations about the presence of foreign troops.  He added,  We will not allow the building of structures. Clearly, Duterte is not the sort of leader the Pentagon envisaged for the Philippines.   If he becomes Philippine President there will inevitably be concern in Washington that its elaborate plans for an anti-Chinese coalition in the region could be scuttled.The New Silk Road Pays A Pit Stop To The PhilippinesWorse still for the US Duterte is saying the Philippines and China could have peaceful and pragmatic relations with each other, engaging in bilateral dialogue over their disputes without the meddling interference of the US.What that would mean for the US is that the Philippines might become a tacit Chinese ally, which would completely upend the regional strategic balance.That is not what Duterte is actually calling for, but he did say is that he not only would be open to talking to Beijing, but would even further and engage in joint exploration in the South China Sea. Further, in seeking to develop the decades-neglected infrastructure of one of the most promising economies of Asia, Duterte has suggested that he would be open to inviting China to build a railroad and other types of connective projects that Beijing has become globally renowned for. This would of course mean replacing US contractors   traditionally heavily entrenched in the Philippines   with cheaper and possibly more efficient Chinese ones   potentially causing US companies to lose out from billions of dollars of construction deals.Joint maritime exploration and infrastructure cooperation between the Philippines and China has the potential to turn the entire Philippines archipelago into the latest pit stop for China s New Silk Road, presenting the US with its biggest geopolitical setback since the reunification of Crimea with Russia.Concluding ThoughtsThe entire future of the US s Pivot to Asia hangs in the balance as Filipinos go to the polls in what is shaping up to be the most pivotal election in their country s history.While the US and its allied politicians are preaching a campaign of anti-Chinese fear mongering and war, Rodrigo Duterte is bucking the system and preaching the benefits the Philippines could reap from more pragmatic policies.By questioning the need for the Enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement and subtly threatening to subvert it, Duterte has made himself the US s enemy number one amongst politicians from the Asia-Pacific. No other individual is speaking out in this way and unlike others who have come before him, he seems to command a high level of genuine people support.If Duterte succeeds in winning the Presidency, it could represent a paradigm shift in Philippine history and the region s geopolitics, resulting in the US losing its second  unsinkable aircraft carrier  and having its Pivot to Asia   ie. its plan to  contain  China   fail before it has even properly got underway.***READ MORE PHILIPPINES NEWS AT 21ST CENTURY WIRE S:  PHILIPPINES FILESSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV\",\n          \"Hillary Clinton wins debate, Bernie Sanders rises in polls Washington (CNN) With the first Democratic debate in the books, a new CNN/ORC poll finds most who watched think Hillary Clinton had the best performance of the night, but her strong showing hasn't boosted her standing in the race for the party's nomination.\\n\\nClinton stands at 45% in the race for the Democratic nomination, with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders behind her at 29%. Vice President Joe Biden, who is considering a run for presidency and did not participate in last week's debate, follows at 18%.\\n\\nBehind the top three, former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb had 1% support, while former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee, Harvard professor Larry Lessig and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley all held less than 1% support.\\n\\nCompared with pre-debate polling, Sanders' support is up five points since mid-September, but no other candidate showed significant change.\\n\\nAs Biden mulls whether or not to get in the race, the poll suggests Democrats are becoming less enamored of a run from the vice president. In August, 53% of registered Democrats said they wanted Biden to run, that's down to 47% in the new poll. Should Biden decide to sit out the race for the Democratic nomination, Clinton's lead over Sanders climbs to 23 points: 56% would back Clinton, 33% Sanders.\\n\\nOverall, 31% of registered Democrats say they watched all or most of the CNN/Facebook debate, held October 13 in Las Vegas. More than 6-in-10 Democrats who watched say Clinton did the best job, almost doubling the 35% who thought Sanders had the best performance. On the other side of the coin, 43% of those who watched said Chafee had the worst night, 31% thought Webb did, 12% O'Malley.\\n\\nAmong those Democrats who watched the debate, both Sanders and Biden are viewed more favorably than they are among Democratic voters generally: Sanders' favorability number bumps from 62% among all Democratic voters to 84% among debate viewers, while Biden climbs from 76% to 89% favorable. Clinton's numbers are about the same in both groups.\\n\\nDespite their positive feelings toward Biden, debate-watchers are more apt than others to say Biden should stay out of the contest (61% think he should not run, compared with 43% of those who did not watch) and they are far more likely to be satisfied with the Democratic field generally (84% compared with 64% among those who didn't watch).\\n\\nAssessing the lesser-known candidates, debate-watchers are more positive than other Democrats toward O'Malley, (44% favorable compared with 20% among Democratic voters generally). But Webb and Chafee are both viewed more negatively among those who watched (For Chafee, 32% unfavorable among debate-watchers vs. 18% among all Democratic voters; Webb is at 37% unfavorable among debate-watchers, 20% among all Democratic voters).\\n\\nFollowing the debate, Clinton continues to dominate as the more trusted candidate across several top issues, with double-digit advantages over Sanders and Biden as the candidate who would best handle the economy, health care, foreign policy, race relations, climate change and gun policy. Clinton also now holds a small edge over Sanders as most trusted on income inequality (43% Clinton, 38% Sanders).\\n\\nDebate-watchers are more likely than others to say they trust Sanders on top issues, though even among this more-friendly audience, he continues to trail Clinton on most issues. Exceptions are income inequality (50% of debate-watchers trust Sanders vs. 36% for Clinton) and climate change (40% each say Clinton and Sanders would be best able to handle that).\\n\\nSanders gained no ground, however, on foreign policy. On that question, Clinton's strength grows among those who watched: 77% in that group say they trust her most to handle foreign policy, up from 66% among Democratic voters overall.\\n\\nOn two issues where the debate highlighted differences among the candidates, fissures within the Democratic electorate on who would best handle them emerge.\\n\\nIncome inequality appears to be the most divisive issue, with women, older voters, those without college degrees, moderates and those with lower incomes more apt to trust Clinton on the issue, while those with college degrees, liberals, and urbanites are more likely to favor Sanders.\\n\\nAnd on gun policy, there's a sharp gender divide. Women are far more likely to say they trust Clinton to handle it than men, 50% to 37%. Democratic gun owners are more evenly split on the question, with 35% saying they trust Clinton most on gun policy, 27% Sanders and 21% Biden. Among those Democrats who do not own guns, it's 48% Clinton, 21% Biden and 16% Sanders.\\n\\nOverall, Democrats aren't much more satisfied with their field now than they were in July before any debates had happened. While the share \\\"very satisfied\\\" has risen from 26% to 33%, the share saying they are at least fairly satisfied has held steady at about 7-in-10. Women do report feeling more satisfied with the field than men, but younger Democrats, a key group for Barack Obama's general election victories, are far less satisfied with this field of candidates than older Democrats. Only about one-quarter of those under age 50 say they are very satisfied, compared with 40% of those age 50 or older.\\n\\nWhen matched against the top candidates from the Republican field, Clinton, Sanders and Biden all top Donald Trump, who has been leading most polling on the Republican nomination contest since this summer. But Biden is the only one who holds a significant lead over Ben Carson, a more recent addition to the top of the Republican field. Trump trails Clinton by 5, Sanders by 9 and Biden by 10. But against Carson, both Clinton (47% to Carson's 48%) and Sanders (46% to Carson's 48%) run about evenly with the former neurosurgeon. Biden tops Carson by 8 points.\\n\\nThe CNN/ORC International Poll was conducted by telephone October 14-17 among a random national sample of 1,028 adult Americans. Results among the 425 registered voters who say they are Democrats or independents who lean toward the Democratic Party have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 5 percentage points.\",\n          \"Sanders expected to endorse Clinton on Tuesday: New York Times WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrat Bernie Sanders is expected to endorse presidential rival Hillary Clinton on Tuesday at a campaign event in New Hampshire, The New York Times reported on Thursday. Citing three Democrats who have been involved in the planning, the Times said the endorsement was partly the result of daily talks between the candidates\\u2019 campaign managers about bringing them together and advancing Sanders\\u2019 policy priorities. The Sanders campaign declined to comment. Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, has resisted endorsing Clinton in a show of party unity since she clinched the Democratic nomination last month. Sanders chose to continue his campaign as leverage to win concessions on his liberal policy agenda and reforms to the Democratic Party nominating process. In a speech to supporters last month, Sanders vowed to help Clinton defeat Republican Donald Trump in the Nov. 8 election but did not end his campaign. Sanders risked being left behind, however, as other prominent Democrats have rallied around Clinton, including President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a favorite of the party\\u2019s liberal wing. Clinton, who shifted to the left under pressure from Sanders during the campaign, adopted another of his issues on Wednesday when she proposed eliminating tuition at public colleges and universities for in-state students whose families earn less than $125,000 annually. Sanders\\u2019 endorsement is expected to ensure he has a prominent speaking slot at the Democratic convention later this month, the Times quoted the three Democrats as saying. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":2}],"source":["from google.colab import files\n","\n","\n","df = pd.read_csv('train.csv')\n","df['text'] = df['title'].fillna('') + ' ' + df['text'].fillna('')\n","df = df[['text', 'label']].dropna()\n","df.head()\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"id":"76cec2ab","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":206},"id":"76cec2ab","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1746244116311,"user_tz":-600,"elapsed":41702,"user":{"displayName":"Yuxuan Ji","userId":"08720692471640893414"}},"outputId":"09c04ce5-2cb5-45c5-f1e0-dc7e4de6ce76"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                                text  label  \\\n","0  LAW ENFORCEMENT ON HIGH ALERT Following Threat...      1   \n","1     Did they post their votes for Hillary already?      1   \n","2  UNBELIEVABLE!

(Photo: IBT)Andrew Korybko The DuranMay 2016: As Filipinos choose their next President on Monday, prospect of election of anti-establishment candidate threatens the geopolitical viability of the US s Pivot to Asia.The Philippines votes for its next President on Monday.  Whilst the rest of the world pays little attention, strategists in Washington are worried.The electoral frontrunner is Rodrigo Duterte, an eccentric, no-nonsense former mayor from the southern island of Mindanao who commands a Trump-like popularity and an equally loyal following. He has shaken Philippine politics to its core over the past couple of months, defying establishment pundits who   just as they did with Trump   wrongly predicted that his campaign would fizzle out over the course of each passing week.Having totally underestimated just how dissatisfied most Filipinos are with the status quo, Duterte s rivals missed the chance to outshine him by his anti-system rhetoric. With the race in its final days that is now too late.  Instead   also paralleling what happened with Trump   there are desperate calls for coalitions and deals to stop him.Should these fail and should Duterte win on Monday, he promises a geopolitical revolution unlike anything the Philippines has ever seen in its history. Pivoting To Asia Through The PhilippinesThe US s Pivot to Asia was announced by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the fall of 2011 with the unstated but obvious goal of  containing  China. Key to this strategy is the  rebalancing    as the Pentagon calls it   of an estimated 60% of its overseas forces to the Asia-Pacific theatre. Such a major deployment requires many more bases than the US currently has in the region. The US has therefore sought the help of the loyal leader of its former Philippines colony, Benigno Aquino III, to find a way to re-open its bases in the Philippines which under popular pressure were closed in the 1990s.Using the  China threat  as the  plausibly justifiable  reason for doing so, but aware that the Philippines people still resent their former coloniser and are proud of having forced the US to close its Philippines bases at the end of the Cold War, the US has devised what it calls an  Enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement  (EDCA) that allows for the  rotational presence  of American troops in at least five separate bases, one of which is located on the strategic island of Palawan that abuts the South China Sea.Although not legally  permanent  or  officially  controlled by the US, this wink-and-a-nod arrangement would in reality allow the US to redeploy its forces to the Philippines, returning the Philippines archipelago to the role of the US s second  unsinkable aircraft carrier  (alongside Japan) which it had during the Cold War.The  China Containment Coalition The Pentagon plans to use the Philippines as the maritime lynch of its  China Containment Coalition  (CCC), gathering all of its allies  navies together and deploying them within provocative striking range of China s claimed islands.The other three members of the US-led Quadrilateral Security Dialogue   Japan, India, and Australia   would find their own way to  rotate  their military units throughout the Philippines islands as well, thereby forming the core of the CCC.To add a regional element to this mix, the plan is for the Philippines and Vietnam, both of which contest some of China s maritime claims, to intensify their strategic cooperation to the point of a mutual defence treaty. This would draw Vietnam into the network of the anti-China coalition being built up by Washington by using the defence ties between Vietnam and the Philippines to making the members of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue de facto allies of Vietnam.Altogether, the Pentagon plan is to produce a critical mass of hostile states near China s southern maritime border which backed by the US could quickly  counter  any moves by Beijing thereby  containing  it to the East Asian mainland.Duterte s RevolutionEverything was proceeding according to plan until Duterte began to question the  Enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement . While his running mate has said Duterte would honour the agreement, he added that he would do so  from a position of strength .Back in October 2014, Duterte went on record to say the  Enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement  should be scrapped if it allowed US servicemen in the Philippines to avoid justice for any crimes they committed.This pinpoints an issue very sensitive for Filipinos who have vivid memories of how US troops were able to escape punishment for acts of gross misbehaviour whilst the US military occupied its bases in the Philippines.  Public anger over this issue was one of the key factors in mobilising local opposition to the bases and explains why many Filipinos oppose their return.Since it is impossible to imagine such an incident not arising at some point, it is all but inevitable that a situation will occur which will fulfil Duterte s criterion for scrapping the  Enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement  Taken together with Duterte s assertion that he intends to deal with the US  from a position of strength  it is easy to see how this might trigger the process of revoking the agreement.No Filipino politician has previously spoken about the US in this way.  Moreover other things he has said also suggest an intention to send a strongly independent line.Not surprisingly the Pentagon-affiliated publication  Starts and Stripes , which writes for US servicemen servicemen and their families, published a scathing critique of Duterte just last week.  Here are some excerpts: With Filipinos set to choose among five candidates on May 9, Duterte, the incumbent mayor of Davao City who has said the U.S.  should not meddle in our affairs,  holds a strong lead, according to the most recent poll released Sunday.Duterte is very popular now because people are sick and tired of the same old, same old,  said Virginia Bacay Watson, a professor at the Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies in Honolulu.  He s kind of a fresh face, fresh perspective, compared to the other elites who are running. Duterte has presented himself to voters as a straight-talker who is not part of the Manila elite   someone who can get things done even if he needs to bend the rules to do so. That includes the country s foreign affairs. He feels that American influence is too strong, that we re too dependent on U.S. intervention in anything we do,  said Babe Romualdez, an opinion columnist for The Philippine Star newspaper who has interviewed the candidates one-on-one about their platforms on the U.S. military and relations with China. He was an activist when he was a student and young lawyer,  Romualdez said.  I get a sense that he s saying the same things that most of the militants say. In Romualdez s interview with the front-runner, the candidate said  we really don t need the Americans to deal with the Chinese because the Chinese want to talk to us alone. If I become president I m going to reach out to the Chinese and talk to them alone without American intervention,  he said.Duterte publically opposed the Visiting Forces Agreement with the U.S.   of which the EDCA was an amendment   and claimed in 2013 that he had rejected a request by the U.S. to establish Davao as a base of operations for drones.Earlier this year, he was quoted saying that although the country was now bound by the EDCA, he had  reservations about the presence of foreign troops.  He added,  We will not allow the building of structures. Clearly, Duterte is not the sort of leader the Pentagon envisaged for the Philippines.   If he becomes Philippine President there will inevitably be concern in Washington that its elaborate plans for an anti-Chinese coalition in the region could be scuttled.The New Silk Road Pays A Pit Stop To The PhilippinesWorse still for the US Duterte is saying the Philippines and China could have peaceful and pragmatic relations with each other, engaging in bilateral dialogue over their disputes without the meddling interference of the US.What that would mean for the US is that the Philippines might become a tacit Chinese ally, which would completely upend the regional strategic balance.That is not what Duterte is actually calling for, but he did say is that he not only would be open to talking to Beijing, but would even further and engage in joint exploration in the South China Sea. Further, in seeking to develop the decades-neglected infrastructure of one of the most promising economies of Asia, Duterte has suggested that he would be open to inviting China to build a railroad and other types of connective projects that Beijing has become globally renowned for. This would of course mean replacing US contractors   traditionally heavily entrenched in the Philippines   with cheaper and possibly more efficient Chinese ones   potentially causing US companies to lose out from billions of dollars of construction deals.Joint maritime exploration and infrastructure cooperation between the Philippines and China has the potential to turn the entire Philippines archipelago into the latest pit stop for China s New Silk Road, presenting the US with its biggest geopolitical setback since the reunification of Crimea with Russia.Concluding ThoughtsThe entire future of the US s Pivot to Asia hangs in the balance as Filipinos go to the polls in what is shaping up to be the most pivotal election in their country s history.While the US and its allied politicians are preaching a campaign of anti-Chinese fear mongering and war, Rodrigo Duterte is bucking the system and preaching the benefits the Philippines could reap from more pragmatic policies.By questioning the need for the Enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement and subtly threatening to subvert it, Duterte has made himself the US s enemy number one amongst politicians from the Asia-Pacific. No other individual is speaking out in this way and unlike others who have come before him, he seems to command a high level of genuine people support.If Duterte succeeds in winning the Presidency, it could represent a paradigm shift in Philippine history and the region s geopolitics, resulting in the US losing its second  unsinkable aircraft carrier  and having its Pivot to Asia   ie. its plan to  contain  China   fail before it has even properly got underway.***READ MORE PHILIPPINES NEWS AT 21ST CENTURY WIRE S:  PHILIPPINES FILESSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV\",\n          \"Hillary Clinton wins debate, Bernie Sanders rises in polls Washington (CNN) With the first Democratic debate in the books, a new CNN/ORC poll finds most who watched think Hillary Clinton had the best performance of the night, but her strong showing hasn't boosted her standing in the race for the party's nomination.\\n\\nClinton stands at 45% in the race for the Democratic nomination, with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders behind her at 29%. Vice President Joe Biden, who is considering a run for presidency and did not participate in last week's debate, follows at 18%.\\n\\nBehind the top three, former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb had 1% support, while former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee, Harvard professor Larry Lessig and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley all held less than 1% support.\\n\\nCompared with pre-debate polling, Sanders' support is up five points since mid-September, but no other candidate showed significant change.\\n\\nAs Biden mulls whether or not to get in the race, the poll suggests Democrats are becoming less enamored of a run from the vice president. In August, 53% of registered Democrats said they wanted Biden to run, that's down to 47% in the new poll. Should Biden decide to sit out the race for the Democratic nomination, Clinton's lead over Sanders climbs to 23 points: 56% would back Clinton, 33% Sanders.\\n\\nOverall, 31% of registered Democrats say they watched all or most of the CNN/Facebook debate, held October 13 in Las Vegas. More than 6-in-10 Democrats who watched say Clinton did the best job, almost doubling the 35% who thought Sanders had the best performance. On the other side of the coin, 43% of those who watched said Chafee had the worst night, 31% thought Webb did, 12% O'Malley.\\n\\nAmong those Democrats who watched the debate, both Sanders and Biden are viewed more favorably than they are among Democratic voters generally: Sanders' favorability number bumps from 62% among all Democratic voters to 84% among debate viewers, while Biden climbs from 76% to 89% favorable. Clinton's numbers are about the same in both groups.\\n\\nDespite their positive feelings toward Biden, debate-watchers are more apt than others to say Biden should stay out of the contest (61% think he should not run, compared with 43% of those who did not watch) and they are far more likely to be satisfied with the Democratic field generally (84% compared with 64% among those who didn't watch).\\n\\nAssessing the lesser-known candidates, debate-watchers are more positive than other Democrats toward O'Malley, (44% favorable compared with 20% among Democratic voters generally). But Webb and Chafee are both viewed more negatively among those who watched (For Chafee, 32% unfavorable among debate-watchers vs. 18% among all Democratic voters; Webb is at 37% unfavorable among debate-watchers, 20% among all Democratic voters).\\n\\nFollowing the debate, Clinton continues to dominate as the more trusted candidate across several top issues, with double-digit advantages over Sanders and Biden as the candidate who would best handle the economy, health care, foreign policy, race relations, climate change and gun policy. Clinton also now holds a small edge over Sanders as most trusted on income inequality (43% Clinton, 38% Sanders).\\n\\nDebate-watchers are more likely than others to say they trust Sanders on top issues, though even among this more-friendly audience, he continues to trail Clinton on most issues. Exceptions are income inequality (50% of debate-watchers trust Sanders vs. 36% for Clinton) and climate change (40% each say Clinton and Sanders would be best able to handle that).\\n\\nSanders gained no ground, however, on foreign policy. On that question, Clinton's strength grows among those who watched: 77% in that group say they trust her most to handle foreign policy, up from 66% among Democratic voters overall.\\n\\nOn two issues where the debate highlighted differences among the candidates, fissures within the Democratic electorate on who would best handle them emerge.\\n\\nIncome inequality appears to be the most divisive issue, with women, older voters, those without college degrees, moderates and those with lower incomes more apt to trust Clinton on the issue, while those with college degrees, liberals, and urbanites are more likely to favor Sanders.\\n\\nAnd on gun policy, there's a sharp gender divide. Women are far more likely to say they trust Clinton to handle it than men, 50% to 37%. Democratic gun owners are more evenly split on the question, with 35% saying they trust Clinton most on gun policy, 27% Sanders and 21% Biden. Among those Democrats who do not own guns, it's 48% Clinton, 21% Biden and 16% Sanders.\\n\\nOverall, Democrats aren't much more satisfied with their field now than they were in July before any debates had happened. While the share \\\"very satisfied\\\" has risen from 26% to 33%, the share saying they are at least fairly satisfied has held steady at about 7-in-10. Women do report feeling more satisfied with the field than men, but younger Democrats, a key group for Barack Obama's general election victories, are far less satisfied with this field of candidates than older Democrats. Only about one-quarter of those under age 50 say they are very satisfied, compared with 40% of those age 50 or older.\\n\\nWhen matched against the top candidates from the Republican field, Clinton, Sanders and Biden all top Donald Trump, who has been leading most polling on the Republican nomination contest since this summer. But Biden is the only one who holds a significant lead over Ben Carson, a more recent addition to the top of the Republican field. Trump trails Clinton by 5, Sanders by 9 and Biden by 10. But against Carson, both Clinton (47% to Carson's 48%) and Sanders (46% to Carson's 48%) run about evenly with the former neurosurgeon. Biden tops Carson by 8 points.\\n\\nThe CNN/ORC International Poll was conducted by telephone October 14-17 among a random national sample of 1,028 adult Americans. Results among the 425 registered voters who say they are Democrats or independents who lean toward the Democratic Party have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 5 percentage points.\",\n          \"Sanders expected to endorse Clinton on Tuesday: New York Times WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrat Bernie Sanders is expected to endorse presidential rival Hillary Clinton on Tuesday at a campaign event in New Hampshire, The New York Times reported on Thursday. Citing three Democrats who have been involved in the planning, the Times said the endorsement was partly the result of daily talks between the candidates\\u2019 campaign managers about bringing them together and advancing Sanders\\u2019 policy priorities. The Sanders campaign declined to comment. Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, has resisted endorsing Clinton in a show of party unity since she clinched the Democratic nomination last month. Sanders chose to continue his campaign as leverage to win concessions on his liberal policy agenda and reforms to the Democratic Party nominating process. In a speech to supporters last month, Sanders vowed to help Clinton defeat Republican Donald Trump in the Nov. 8 election but did not end his campaign. Sanders risked being left behind, however, as other prominent Democrats have rallied around Clinton, including President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a favorite of the party\\u2019s liberal wing. Clinton, who shifted to the left under pressure from Sanders during the campaign, adopted another of his issues on Wednesday when she proposed eliminating tuition at public colleges and universities for in-state students whose families earn less than $125,000 annually.
