An aggregate of polls modelled by the Washington Post shows that the US vice-president has become newly competitive in four southern Sun belt states that were previously leaning heavily towards Donald Trump, the Republican nominee and former president. If the trend holds, it means Harris could eke out an electoral college victory either by winning those states ?\\u00a1\\u00ecC Georgia, Arizona, Nevada and North Carolina ?\\u00a1\\u00ecC or, alternatively, by capturing three swing states in the midwestern Rust belt, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. Trump, by contrast, would need to capture both groups of states to earn the 270 electoral college votes necessary to secure victory, according to the model. The opening up of a potential second front in Harris??\\u00a3\\u00a4s pathway to victory may be the biggest boon yet from her elevation to the top of the Democratic ticket in place of Biden, whose only path to staying in office appeared to hinge on winning the three Rust belt states. Harris has gained an average of two percentage points nationally, and 2.1% in seven battleground states, since replacing Biden, who pulled out of the race on 21 July after weeks of intense pressure over a bad debate performance the previous month. The transformation in the party??\\u00a3\\u00a4s chances of retaining the White House amounts to a ???reset??\\u00a8\\u00a4 of the election race and might even make Harris a ???slight favourite??\\u00a8\\u00a4, according to the analysis. It is largely due to renewed impetus in key swing states under the candidacy of Harris and Tim Walz, the Minnesota governor who she chose as her running mate. The outcome of US presidential elections is determined not by the popular vote, but by which candidate wins a majority of 538 electoral college votes, which are allotted state by state. Polls show many things, but in aggregate they appear to suggest that Harris now leads in the Rust belt states of Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and has closed the gap in another, Michigan, to within one point of Trump, the former president and Republican nominee. Biden won all three states, albeit by narrow margins, in 2020. But she has also significantly improved on Biden??\\u00a3\\u00a4s post-debate standing ?\\u00a1\\u00ecC when the president??\\u00a3\\u00a4s poll position evaporated badly in all key states and even began to deteriorate in states previously considered safe ?\\u00a1\\u00ecC in three Sun belt states, Nevada, Arizona and Georgia, plus North Carolina, where she has pulled close enough to Trump to be within the polls??\\u00a3\\u00a4 margin of error. Biden won the first of those three states, again by narrow margins, in 2020 but lost North Carolina by less than two percentage points. Amid Harris??\\u00a3\\u00a4s recent surge, Democratic strategists have started to envision carrying the state, despite the party only having won it once in presidential elections since 1980. The uptick in support makes her competitive in more states than\",\n          \"???America??\\u00a3\\u00a4s Mess with Mexico ?\\u00a1\\u00ecC A Fareed Zakaria Special,??\\u00a8\\u00a4 Premieres Sunday, June 23 at 8:00pm ET on CNN & CNNi - CNN Press Room ???America??\\u00a3\\u00a4s Mess with Mexico ?\\u00a1\\u00ecC A Fareed Zakaria Special,??\\u00a8\\u00a4 Premieres Sunday, June 23 at 8:00pm ET on CNN & CNNi - CNN Press Room ???America??\\u00a3\\u00a4s Mess with Mexico ?\\u00a1\\u00ecC A Fareed Zakaria Special,??\\u00a8\\u00a4 Premieres Sunday, June 23 at 8:00pm ET on CNN & CNNi Fareed Zakaria examines how America??\\u00a3\\u00a4s influence on its southern neighbor has impacted Mexico??\\u00a3\\u00a4s moves towards illiberalism ?\\u00a1\\u00ecC and what it means for America??\\u00a3\\u00a4s own future PREVIEW: Mexico??\\u00a3\\u00a4s historic election will send Claudia Sheinbaum, the country??\\u00a3\\u00a4s first woman and person of Jewish faith, to the National Palace as the incoming president, in October. But marring the celebrations of the impressive firsts were candidate assassinations that preceded the election, and nationwide violence at the polls. People who have long watched Mexican politics also see warning signs for the ruling party??\\u00a3\\u00a4s commitment to democracy: government restrictions of press freedoms and judicial independence, allegations of marginalization by indigenous people, and intimidation of minority political parties. CNN??\\u00a3\\u00a4s Fareed Zakaria explores these issues in a new one-hour special, AMERICA??\\u00a3\\u00a4S MESS WITH MEXICO ?\\u00a1\\u00ecC A Fareed Zakaria Special, to premiere Sunday, June 23, at 8:00pm ET, on CNN & CNN International. The special will encore on CNN at 11:00pm ET (8:00pm PT). To understand how the relationship between the United States and Mexico is both ???crucial ?- and complicated,??\\u00a8\\u00a4 in interviews with experts, Zakaria discusses how America has been dependent upon Mexico to help manage the mass migration of those fleeing violence and economic hardship. And, it has been nearly two hundred years since the United States declared war upon Mexico, radically changing both nations??\\u00a3\\u00a4 borders. Eventually, the two countries were linked through transnational trade ?\\u00a1\\u00ecC and the drug cartels ?\\u00a1\\u00ecC that have created economic disparities and cultural disruption. Mexican politics have also long impacted ?\\u00a1\\u00ecC and divided ?\\u00a1\\u00ecC politics in the United States. Importantly, Zakaria notes, Mexico is America??\\u00a3\\u00a4s top trading partner ?\\u00a1\\u00ecC even outranking China and Canada. And, Mexico and America partner on everything from immigration to drug investigations, to water management. However, Zakaria warns, anti-corruption efforts, civil reforms, and democracy itself in Mexico have seemed to be deprioritized by America in favor of stability at the border ?\\u00a1\\u00ecC and short-term politics. To explore these themes, interviewed for AMERICA??\\u00a3\\u00a4S MESS WITH MEXICO are: Jonathan Blitzer, journalist; author, Everyone Who Is Gone Is Here: The United States, Central America, and the Making of a Crisis (2024); Peter Goodman, global economics correspondent, The New York Times; author, How the World Ran Out of Everything: Inside the Global Supply Chain (2024) Anabel Hernandez, journalist; author, The Traitor: Inside the World??\\u00a3\\u00a4s Most Powerful Drug Cartel(2023); and, Shannon K.

An aggregate of polls modelled by the Washington Post shows that the US vice-president has become newly competitive in four southern Sun belt states that were previously leaning heavily towards Donald Trump, the Republican nominee and former president. If the trend holds, it means Harris could eke out an electoral college victory either by winning those states ?\\u00a1\\u00ecC Georgia, Arizona, Nevada and North Carolina ?\\u00a1\\u00ecC or, alternatively, by capturing three swing states in the midwestern Rust belt, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. Trump, by contrast, would need to capture both groups of states to earn the 270 electoral college votes necessary to secure victory, according to the model. The opening up of a potential second front in Harris??\\u00a3\\u00a4s pathway to victory may be the biggest boon yet from her elevation to the top of the Democratic ticket in place of Biden, whose only path to staying in office appeared to hinge on winning the three Rust belt states. Harris has gained an average of two percentage points nationally, and 2.1% in seven battleground states, since replacing Biden, who pulled out of the race on 21 July after weeks of intense pressure over a bad debate performance the previous month. The transformation in the party??\\u00a3\\u00a4s chances of retaining the White House amounts to a ???reset??\\u00a8\\u00a4 of the election race and might even make Harris a ???slight favourite??\\u00a8\\u00a4, according to the analysis. It is largely due to renewed impetus in key swing states under the candidacy of Harris and Tim Walz, the Minnesota governor who she chose as her running mate. The outcome of US presidential elections is determined not by the popular vote, but by which candidate wins a majority of 538 electoral college votes, which are allotted state by state. Polls show many things, but in aggregate they appear to suggest that Harris now leads in the Rust belt states of Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and has closed the gap in another, Michigan, to within one point of Trump, the former president and Republican nominee. Biden won all three states, albeit by narrow margins, in 2020. But she has also significantly improved on Biden??\\u00a3\\u00a4s post-debate standing ?\\u00a1\\u00ecC when the president??\\u00a3\\u00a4s poll position evaporated badly in all key states and even began to deteriorate in states previously considered safe ?\\u00a1\\u00ecC in three Sun belt states, Nevada, Arizona and Georgia, plus North Carolina, where she has pulled close enough to Trump to be within the polls??\\u00a3\\u00a4 margin of error. Biden won the first of those three states, again by narrow margins, in 2020 but lost North Carolina by less than two percentage points. Amid Harris??\\u00a3\\u00a4s recent surge, Democratic strategists have started to envision carrying the state, despite the party only having won it once in presidential elections since 1980. The uptick in support makes her competitive in more states than\",\n          \"???America??\\u00a3\\u00a4s Mess with Mexico ?\\u00a1\\u00ecC A Fareed Zakaria Special,??\\u00a8\\u00a4 Premieres Sunday, June 23 at 8:00pm ET on CNN & CNNi - CNN Press Room ???America??\\u00a3\\u00a4s Mess with Mexico ?\\u00a1\\u00ecC A Fareed Zakaria Special,??\\u00a8\\u00a4 Premieres Sunday, June 23 at 8:00pm ET on CNN & CNNi - CNN Press Room ???America??\\u00a3\\u00a4s Mess with Mexico ?\\u00a1\\u00ecC A Fareed Zakaria Special,??\\u00a8\\u00a4 Premieres Sunday, June 23 at 8:00pm ET on CNN & CNNi Fareed Zakaria examines how America??\\u00a3\\u00a4s influence on its southern neighbor has impacted Mexico??\\u00a3\\u00a4s moves towards illiberalism ?\\u00a1\\u00ecC and what it means for America??\\u00a3\\u00a4s own future PREVIEW: Mexico??\\u00a3\\u00a4s historic election will send Claudia Sheinbaum, the country??\\u00a3\\u00a4s first woman and person of Jewish faith, to the National Palace as the incoming president, in October. But marring the celebrations of the impressive firsts were candidate assassinations that preceded the election, and nationwide violence at the polls. People who have long watched Mexican politics also see warning signs for the ruling party??\\u00a3\\u00a4s commitment to democracy: government restrictions of press freedoms and judicial independence, allegations of marginalization by indigenous people, and intimidation of minority political parties. CNN??\\u00a3\\u00a4s Fareed Zakaria explores these issues in a new one-hour special, AMERICA??\\u00a3\\u00a4S MESS WITH MEXICO ?\\u00a1\\u00ecC A Fareed Zakaria Special, to premiere Sunday, June 23, at 8:00pm ET, on CNN & CNN International. The special will encore on CNN at 11:00pm ET (8:00pm PT). To understand how the relationship between the United States and Mexico is both ???crucial ?- and complicated,??\\u00a8\\u00a4 in interviews with experts, Zakaria discusses how America has been dependent upon Mexico to help manage the mass migration of those fleeing violence and economic hardship. And, it has been nearly two hundred years since the United States declared war upon Mexico, radically changing both nations??\\u00a3\\u00a4 borders. Eventually, the two countries were linked through transnational trade ?\\u00a1\\u00ecC and the drug cartels ?\\u00a1\\u00ecC that have created economic disparities and cultural disruption. Mexican politics have also long impacted ?\\u00a1\\u00ecC and divided ?\\u00a1\\u00ecC politics in the United States. Importantly, Zakaria notes, Mexico is America??\\u00a3\\u00a4s top trading partner ?\\u00a1\\u00ecC even outranking China and Canada. And, Mexico and America partner on everything from immigration to drug investigations, to water management. However, Zakaria warns, anti-corruption efforts, civil reforms, and democracy itself in Mexico have seemed to be deprioritized by America in favor of stability at the border ?\\u00a1\\u00ecC and short-term politics. To explore these themes, interviewed for AMERICA??\\u00a3\\u00a4S MESS WITH MEXICO are: Jonathan Blitzer, journalist; author, Everyone Who Is Gone Is Here: The United States, Central America, and the Making of a Crisis (2024); Peter Goodman, global economics correspondent, The New York Times; author, How the World Ran Out of Everything: Inside the Global Supply Chain (2024) Anabel Hernandez, journalist; author, The Traitor: Inside the World??\\u00a3\\u00a4s Most Powerful Drug Cartel(2023); and, Shannon K.
